### Samekichi here. 
- Currently a freshman taking zoom courses (somewhat more convenient than the traditional ones, I guess =q=)
- Amateur Chinese translator of Minecraft Fabric Mods (with the ones I'm most satisfied with pinned below.)
- Wish to become a modder sometime, but probably not soon lol

Btw, suggestions on my translations are highly welcome :D
